## Helper scripts for creating and training pytorch based Mask-RCNN

This package is partially based on:

- [Reference training scripts for object detection](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection)

- [Fine-tuning Mask-RCNN using PyTorch](https://haochen23.github.io/2020/06/fine-tune-mask-rcnn-pytorch.html)
